# Fluid4Magisk


## Module Explanation:
A very simple module just to make Fluid work as a rom-integrated (privileged) app systemlessly. It'll simply inject a folder with the apk into the path: /system/priv-app. If it shows Privileged at the app settings, then you're good.

## Requirements: 
- Android 5.0+ (Magisk requirement)
- Magisk v17+

## About the apk:
* Apk downloaded directly from [APKMirror](http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/francisco-barroso/fluid-navigation-gestures "Fluid's APKMirror page"), **original and not tampered in any way**.
